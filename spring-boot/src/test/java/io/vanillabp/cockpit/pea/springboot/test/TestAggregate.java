/**
 * The business case of the test: what the workflow is about and what a details provider
 * changes.
 * <p>
 * It carries a version attribute, and that is what an application with a writing details
 * provider is meant to do. The provider runs while a report is dispatched, in the transaction
 * of that dispatch, so it reads this case long before it writes it back. An application
 * changing the same case in that window would otherwise lose its change without a word: the
 * dispatch writes every field it holds, the older reading among them. With the version
 * attribute the later of the two writers reads a conflict instead. The application answers it
 * by repeating its transaction, and the dispatch answers it by leaving the outbox entry
 * unfinished, which sends the report again from a fresh reading of the case.
